# Introductory-Mini-Project
## Project Description
### Wine Quality Prediction

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyzes basic statistics, correlations, and heatmaps to understand variable relationships.
- Identifies potential predictors (Flavor, Body, and Aroma) based on p-values.
  
**Linear Regression with Selected Predictors:**
- Builds a linear regression model using the identified predictors.

### Diabetes Classification

**EDA:**
- Performs EDA to understand correlations between variables.

**Train-Test Split:**
- Splits the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

**Logistic Regression and LDA:**
- Trains a Logistic Regression model for classification.
- Applies Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and classification.
- Evaluates model performance using confusion matrices, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves.
- Compares LDA and Logistic Regression for better prediction.
